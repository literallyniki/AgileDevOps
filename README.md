<h1>America Votes ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</h1>

__Title:__ Online Voting/Polling System (Secured with Blockchain)

__What and Why:__ As the 2020 election draws closer and closer, we musn't forget the scandals from 2016 concerning voter 
fraud and the hacking of voting machines across the United States. It is evident that a more secure method
of voting must be implemented. The goal here is to design a voting system protected with a blockchain to 
securely store voting information without the paranoia of tampering. A voter would be able to register just 
as they normally would using 6-point ID, access and update their voting information through a managed user 
account, and vote on relative local and national elections. Hopefully, this more convenient and secure voting 
system and method increases voter participation and decreased voter fraud/vote tampering.

__For whom:__ Citizens of the United States of America.

__How:__
1. Voter registers with relevant 6-point Identification and can log in to the account once created
2. Voters are allowed to check and edit personal information in their account at any time but can only
vote during election periods. 
3. No voter may vote more than once during the voting period.
   Votes cannot be modified once votes are sent in.
4. Once a user is registered, they can use the same account every year for any local, state, or national
election.
5. When voting, the user will be asked to verify their vote before sending it in. 


__Scope:__
The basic framework of the voting system shouldn't be unmanageable, creating and managing user accounts is something
that is expected in most software. The difficult piece will be verification of identification amongst state government
records, securing the voting information to prevent any of the security concerns, and creating a simple enough system for 
the average American system to be able to vote while feeling like their vote is truly, actually secured.
